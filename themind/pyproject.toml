Can you trust your instincts to know when your number is the smallest?

In The Mind mobile game:

You hold a hidden number.

You have only one button in front of you.

Feel the perfect moment to tap!

If you're right, you score a point!

If you're wrong, you lose a life!

Every decision is a matter of life and death.
Every tap brings you closer to victory... or defeat.

No words. No signs. Just pure feeling.
It's just you — and one critical decision.

Do you have the courage to press the button?

The Mind – Where Silence Is Louder Than Words.
